## Inspiration:
The inspiration behind NetZero stemmed from a collective concern for our planet's future. We aimed to create a game that not only entertains but also educates players about the pressing issue of climate change. Drawing inspiration from real-world efforts to combat global warming, NetZero challenges players to take on the role of a leader striving to make a positive impact on the environment.

## What it does:
NetZero is a strategic simulation game where players take on the role of a world leader. The objective is to guide the world toward a sustainable future by achieving net-zero carbon emissions and keeping global warming below a critical threshold. Players must balance funding, public support, and cutting-edge technology to navigate challenges, reduce carbon emissions, and secure a thriving future for humanity.

## How we built it:
NetZero was crafted by a dedicated team of three using fundamental web technologies and design tools. We harnessed the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop an interactive website that serves as the platform for this environmental simulation game. Leveraging the simplicity and versatility of these technologies allowed us to create a user-friendly and accessible gaming experience. We also used Figma to mockup our application, and Procreate to draw the custom background world map with renewable and nonrenewable resources.

To facilitate seamless data integration and manipulation, we implemented JSON objects, providing an efficient means of parsing and organizing essential game data. The use of these tools not only facilitated the development process but also contributed to the creation of an immersive and educational gaming experience for players everywhere.

## Challenges we ran into:
The development of NetZero presented several challenges, including balancing gameplay mechanics for both enjoyment and education, integrating real-world data into the simulation, and ensuring a seamless user experience. There were also a lot of ideas that we wanted to implement to further enhance the gameplay and re-playability of our game, but we did not have the time to implement such developments. We had to adapt and simplify our original idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:
We are proud to have created a game that not only entertains but also raises awareness about the critical issue of climate change. NetZero successfully combines engaging gameplay with real-world environmental principles, providing players with a meaningful experience. Achieving a balance between entertainment and education, we believe NetZero stands as an accomplishment in the realm of serious games.

## What we learned:
The development of NetZero provided valuable insights into the challenges of translating complex environmental issues into an accessible and enjoyable gaming experience. We learned the importance of player engagement in conveying the urgency of climate action and the potential of gaming as a tool for raising awareness and promoting positive change.

## What's next for NetZero:
The journey for NetZero doesn't end here. Future plans ([some depicted on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jDdrdWVqLQvD1zRRCN0bqd/NetZero?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=yPezkfYhXrXhacIf-1)) include expanding the game with additional features, including:
- more scientifically accurate environmental background in the win/lose screen to talk through actionable steps a real player can take to help sustainability efforts
- improving game-play mechanics and balancing the different policy routes
- making the map interactive so that players could develop renewable resources on specific locations on the map
- map changes based on the policy decisions that the user makes (such as trees dying as temperatures get hotter, more natural disasters occurring)
- new map each game with different generated rivers and starting conditions, to increase re-playability of game and see how game changes
- random events and challenges, such as natural disasters, sudden technological breakthroughs, or global agreements, to more closely replicate the experience of the real world, such that players must adapt and make decisions to navigate through these challenges
- a leaderboard of how quickly users were able to win
- UI changes to make game more user-friendly (pause button, popup walkthrough tutorial to explain the individual components of the game rather than bulky text, ways to see the past enacted policies and delineation of levels, notifications when you can't afford policies due to _____ missing resource)

We'd like to take every opportunity to include information and tips on real-world environmental issues to raise awareness and educate players. We aim to continuously update and refine NetZero based on player feedback, ensuring that the game remains a dynamic and impactful tool for environmental education and advocacy.
